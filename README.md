Hello Recruiters,

This is a simple automation test on the eBay website where I have used Selenium, Java, Jenkins, TestNG, GitHub, Page Object Model, and Maven. This automation test performs some functional (positive/negative) testing, UI testing, and integration testing. This week, I will add Gherkin language to write the test cases. In the upcoming weeks, I will also use Cucumber, and I will create a video to show you how I created the automation test cases from scratch.

If you are looking for someone who can help your company to do this kind of work, please reach out to me. We can talk a lot more about my skills.

I will make a lot more improvements and add more test cases to this repository.

Thank you.
